# Changelog

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-13

### Security

- Session and setup-admin passkeys (`generate_passkey()`) are now generated with a cryptographically secure PRNG (`random_bytes()`) instead of `mt_rand()`
- Password salts (`generate_salt()`) are now generated with `random_int()`; removed a `mt_srand()` reseed that always evaluated to `mt_srand(0)`, which produced predictable salts and corrupted the shared PRNG state
- Account-request form: the proof-of-humanity check now fails closed when no CAPTCHA has been generated, uses a timing-safe comparison (`hash_equals()`), and consumes the token after each attempt to prevent reuse
- Account-request form: user-supplied values are now HTML-encoded in the admin notification email and URL-encoded in the account-creation link, and are HTML-encoded when reflected back into the form, preventing HTML/parameter injection and reflected XSS; control characters are also stripped from the email subject header as defence-in-depth against header injection
- The four issues above (weak PRNG for session/setup passkeys and password salts, the CAPTCHA bypass, and unsanitised account-request input) were reported privately by **red jh0n** — thank you for the responsible disclosure
- Session and setup cookie passkey comparisons now use `hash_equals()`
- Docker image: apply latest security patches at build time
- Docker image: remove build-time dev packages and kernel headers from final image, reducing HIGH CVE count from 46 to 17 (0 CRITICAL)
- Clean up PHPMailer archive from `/tmp` after extraction

### Fixed

- **[#261](https://github.com/wheelybird/luminary/pull/261)** - Fatal error ("Cannot redeclare `open_ldap_connection()`") on MFA and account-expired login paths caused by duplicate `ldap_functions.inc.php` includes
- **[#262](https://github.com/wheelybird/luminary/issues/262)** - `LDAP_TLS_CACERT` / `LDAP_TLS_CACERT_FILE` are now applied on first boot: the entrypoint appends the `TLS_CACERT` directive to `ldap.conf` when none exists (previously a `sed` replacement silently matched nothing, leaving the CA unconfigured)
- Corrected a string-concatenation typo (`+=` → `.=`) in setup-session debug logging
- **[#252](https://github.com/wheelybird/luminary/issues/252)** - Boolean configuration values (including `SMTP_USE_SSL`) now accept `TRUE`, `true`, `1>

### Added

- **[#260](https://github.com/wheelybird/luminary/issues/260)** - `USER_EDITABLE_ATTRIBUTES` now sets the definitive list of attributes users can edit in their profile (e.g. `USER_EDITABLE_ATTRIBUTES=jpegphoto`). If not set, sensible defaults are used.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `USER_EDITABLE_ATTRIBUTES` now replaces the default list rather than adding to it. If you previously set this variable to add extra attributes, you will need to include the defaults you still want. The built-in defaults are: `telephonenumber,mobile,displayname,description,title,jpegphoto,sshpublickey`. For example, if you previously had `USER_EDITABLE_ATTRIBUTES=roomnumber` and want to keep the defaults, change it to `USER_EDITABLE_ATTRIBUTES=telephonenumber,mobile,displayname,description,title,jpegphoto,sshpublickey,roomnumber`.
- **[#254](https://github.com/wheelybird/luminary/issues/254)** - "Powered by Luminary" footer with link to GitHub project (disable with `SHOW_POWERED_BY=FALSE`)


## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed

- **[#246](https://github.com/wheelybird/luminary/issues/246)** - Nested OU support: LDAP functions now search for user DNs instead of constructing them
- Environment variable `_FILE` suffix handling for Docker secrets now processed early in entrypoint
- Group creation UX: button text, attributes tab visibility during creation, MFA tab appearing after creation
- Form structure bugs causing multiple handlers to trigger on single form submission

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-05

### Added

- Self-service password reset via email with token validation and rate limiting
- Optional LDAP storage for application data (sessions, tokens, rate limits) with filesystem fallback
- Automated daily cleanup of expired LDAP data via cron (randomised 3-5am)
- New password reset email events and templates

### Removed

- GROUP_BULK_OPERATIONS_ENABLED, GROUP_TEMPLATES_ENABLED, GROUP_NESTING_ENABLED config placeholders (unimplemented features that were accidentally included)

### Fixed

- **[#242](https://github.com/wheelybird/luminary/issues/242)** - Fatal error when creating initial admin account (undefined STDERR constant)
- **[#241](https://github.com/wheelybird/luminary/issues/241)** - Inconsistent password change email behaviour (checkbox now works correctly)
- **[#240](https://github.com/wheelybird/luminary/issues/240)** - SMTP_HOST_PORT variable maintained for backwards compatibility
- Object class preservation when updating users with MFA enabled (prevents `totpSecret` attribute errors)
- Duplicate group membership update banners (removed duplicate handler include)

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-29

### Backwards Compatibility

**Version 2.0.0 maintains full backwards compatibility with 1.x releases (ldap-user-manager).**

- All existing environment variables unchanged
- New MFA features disabled by default (`MFA_FEATURE_ENABLED=FALSE`)
- No breaking changes to LDAP schema requirements
- Existing user/group management unchanged
- Optional features clearly marked and disabled by default

**Upgrading from v1.11:**

1. **No configuration changes required** - Upgrade works as drop-in replacement
2. **Optional: Enable MFA** - Set `MFA_FEATURE_ENABLED=TRUE` to activate MFA features
3. **Optional: Configure MFA** - Set MFA-related environment variables as needed
4. **LDAP Schema** - If using MFA, add TOTP schema attributes (see ldap-totp-schema project)

#### LDAP Schema Requirements for MFA

Add TOTP attributes to LDAP schema.  See [ldap-totp-schema](https://github.com/wheelybird/ldap-totp-schema) for complete schema definitions and installation instructions.

### Known Issues

- **LDAP ACL verification** - Manual verification required for `totpSecret` access restrictions
